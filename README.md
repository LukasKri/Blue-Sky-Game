## General info
I have started learning programming at the end of 2020 and made a simple game with Pygame module in Python as my first project. The purpose of this project is to create something interesting and fun while learning hard topics, like Object-Oriented Programming.

## Technologies
* Python 3 - version 3.9.0
* Pygame - version 2.0.1

## Setup
You need Python 3.5 or later and Pygame module installed to run Blue Sky, for more information please visit:

## Features
List of features that were challenging for beginner:
* Created a custom Pygame window and made it responsive to user inputs.
* Added custom images of Rocket and UFOs.
* Made separate classes for each essential part of the game.
* Made Rocket to be able to shoot bullets.
* Built a fleet of UFOs and made it move across the screen.
* Implemented collisions of bullets, UFOs and Rocket.

To-do list for further improvement:
* Create a scoring system for competitiveness.
* Develop a leveling up to make it more challenging.
* Tweak the user interface for a better look.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_, because I had to pause it for now. I need to learn new tools ASAP to be able to pass a test and get among the lucky ones who gets invited to the WCC academy.

## Inspiration
Project inspired by Eric Matthes book Python Crash Course, thank you for introducing programming for me.
